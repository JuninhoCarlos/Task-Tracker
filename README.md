# About
This is a simple project that I developed to learn React js. It is a task tracker which consumes and provides data to a an API.

# Setting up 

To run this project it is required to install node. 

# Packages required

I used the following packages:
- json-server (to emulate API calls)
- react-route-dom 

## Running the project

After cloning the project, you can run the project by typing the following command:

- npm run server (to run the json-server which emulates API server)
- npm run start (to run the application)
